# Profiling tools reference

Profiling your application is the best way to measure its performance. You can use different profiling tools to understand where there might be any issues with elements of your application including memory usage, CPU performance, GPU performance, and your custom **scripts**.

## Unity’s analysis tools

Unity has several profiling and analysis tools to measure the performance of your application:

| **Tool** | **Description** |
| --- | --- |
| **[Profiler](Profiler.md)** | Measures the performance of the Unity Editor, your application in Play mode, or connects to a device running your application in development mode. |
| **[Memory Profiler](https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.memoryprofiler@latest)** | Provides in-depth memory performance analysis. |
| **[Profiling Core package](https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.profiling.core@latest)** | Provides APIs you can use to add contextual information to Unity Profiler captures. For more information, refer to [Adding profiling information to your code](profiler-adding-information-code.md). |
| **[Profile Analyzer](https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.performance.profile-analyzer@latest)** | Compares two profiling datasets together to analyze how your changes affect your application’s performance. |
| **[Frame Debugger](FrameDebugger.md)** | Provides a way to measure the graphical performance of your application. |
| **[Project Auditor](project-auditor/project-auditor)** | Creates a report that describes issues about the scripts, assets, and code in your project. |

## Third party profiling tools

Alongside the Unity Profiler, use platform-specific profiling tools to ensure your application runs as expected. These tools have the most utility on platforms that can use [IL2CPP](scripting-backends-il2cpp.md) to produce a C++ version of the project. These native code versions provide transparent call stacks and high-resolution method timings that are unavailable when running under Mono.

The following list provides some examples of available profiling tools. You can also use Unity’s [low level native plug-in Profiler API](LowLevelNativePluginProfiler.md) to export profiling data to third-party profiling tools.
