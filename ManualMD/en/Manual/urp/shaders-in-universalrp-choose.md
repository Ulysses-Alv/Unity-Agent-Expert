# Choose a prebuilt shader in URP

The Universal **Render Pipeline** implements Physically Based Rendering (PBR).

The pipeline provides pre-built **shaders** that can simulate real world materials.

PBR materials provide a set of parameters that let artists achieve consistency between different material types and under different lighting conditions.

## Complex Lit Shader

The [Complex Lit shader](shader-complex-lit.md) is suitable for simulating advanced materials that require more complex lighting evaluation, such as the clear coat effect.

The Complex Lit Shader contains all the functionality of the Lit shader and adds advanced material features. Some features in this shader might be considerably more resource-intensive and require [Unity Shader Model 4.5](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/SL-ShaderCompileTargets.html) hardware.

In the Deferred **Rendering Path**, URP renders objects that have the Complex Lit shader using the **Forward Rendering** Path. If the hardware of the target platform does not support features in the Complex Lit shader, URP uses the Lit shader instead.

## Lit Shader

The URP [Lit shader](lit-shader.md) is suitable for modeling most of the real world materials.

The Lit Shader lets you render real-world surfaces like stone, wood, glass, plastic, and metals in photo-realistic quality. Your light levels and reflections look lifelike and react properly across various lighting conditions, for example bright sunlight, or a dark cave. This Shader uses the most computationally heavy [shading model](shading-model.md) in the Universal Render Pipeline (URP).

For examples of how to use the Lit Shader, refer to the [Shaders samples in URP Package Samples](package-sample-urp-package-samples.md#shaders).

## Simple Lit Shader

URP provides the [Simple Lit shader](simple-lit-shader.md) as a helper to convert non-PBR projects made with the Built-in Render Pipeline to URP. This shader is non-PBR and is not supported by Shader Graph.

Use this Shader when performance is more important than photorealism. This Shader uses a simple approximation for lighting. Because this Shader [does not calculate for physical correctness and energy conservation](shading-model.md#simple-shading), it renders quickly.

## Baked Lit Shader

If you don’t need real-time lighting, or would rather only use [baked lighting](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/LightMode-Baked.html) and sample **global illumination**, choose a Baked Lit Shader.

In the Universal Render Pipeline (URP), use this Shader for stylised games or apps that only require [baked lighting](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/LightMode-Baked.html)via [lightmaps](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/Lightmapping.html) and [Light Probes](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/LightProbes.html). This shader does not use [Physically Based Shading](shading-model.md#physically-based-shading) and has no real-time lighting, so all real-time relevant shader keywords and variants are [stripped](shader-stripping-landing.md) from the Shader code, which makes it faster to calculate.

## Unlit Shader

If you don’t need lighting on a Material at all, you can choose the Unlit Shader.

Use this Shader for effects or unique objects in your visuals that don’t need lighting. Because there are no time-consuming lighting calculations or lookups, this Shader is optimal for lower-end hardware. The Unlit Shader uses the most simple [shading model](shading-model.md) in URP.

## Particle shaders

URP provides the following **particle** shaders:

* Particles Lit Shader - makes particles appear almost photorealistic, for example for camp fire particles, rain drops or torch smoke. This Shader produces lifelike visuals but uses the most computationally heavy [shading model](shading-model.md) in URP, which can impact performance.
* Particles Simple Lit shader - for particles where performance is more important than photorealism. This Shader uses a simple approximation for lighting. Because this Shader [does not calculate for physical correctness and energy conservation](shading-model.md#simple-shading), it renders quickly.
* Particles Unlit Shader - for particles that don’t need lighting. Because there are no time-consuming lighting calculations or lookups, this Shader is optimal for lower-end hardware. The Unlit Shader uses the most simple [shading model](shading-model.md) in the Universal Render Pipeline (URP).
