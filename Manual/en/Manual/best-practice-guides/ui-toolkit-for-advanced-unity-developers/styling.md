Changing style properties directly in UI Builder.

Once you’ve mocked up some wireframe layouts with **visual elements**, you can begin styling them or saving the formatting properties into reusable styles. Styling is where UI Toolkit exhibits its full power.

Adding style to visual elements is preferably done via [Unity style sheet (USS)](../../UIE-USS-Selectors.md) files (**Assets > Create > UI Toolkit > StyleSheet**). They are the Unity equivalent to web CSS files, and use a similar rule-based format. They also add flexibility to the design process making it easy to reuse and styles consistent across the project at scale.

USS files define the size, color, font, spacing, borders, or location of elements.

## USS selectors

If you haven’t created a USS file yet, all the styling changes you make will be embedded directly in the UXML asset as inline styles. While these inline styles affect the appearance of the specific visual element they are attached to, they cannot be reused across your project.

For example, if your project has hundreds of buttons, updating the style of each individual button would be time-consuming and inefficient. Instead, you can define a selector in a USS. [USS selectors](../../UIB-styling-ui-using-uss-selectors.md) make it possible for style sheets in UI Builder to share and apply styles across many elements in UXML assets.

### Convert existing inline styles to selectors

![Inline styles are overrides.](../../../uploads/Main/bpg/uitk/image171.png)

Inline styles are overrides.

Use the **Add Style Class to List** button to type and convert all the inline styles of an element to a selector (starting with “**.**” in yellow). This selector now centralizes the styling properties, allowing you to apply consistent styles to other buttons (or other elements) throughout the project. Any updates made to the selector will automatically reflect on all associated elements, making the process scalable and maintainable.

![Extracting all Inline Style properties to a selector.](../../../uploads/Main/bpg/uitk/image250.png)

Extracting all Inline Style properties to a selector.

To extract specific inline styles to a new selector, click on the vertical ellipsis **(⋮)** next to the property, and select **Extract Inlined Style to Selector / Add Class**, which turns that property into a selector.

### Create new selectors

Selectors query the **visual tree** for any elements that match a given search criteria. UI Toolkit then applies style changes to all matching elements. You can add a new selector by clicking on the field **Add new selector…** in the top left side of UI Builder:

![USS selector reference when creating a new selector.](../../../uploads/Main/bpg/uitk/image50.png)

USS selector reference when creating a new selector.

USS selectors can match visual elements by:

* **Element C# type**: These selectors work by Type (Button, Label, ListView, etc.) The selector matches the available default Type names in the Library panel. They don’t have any special characters in front of the name. Class selectors appear in white. For example, **Button** will apply the style to all the elements of the type **Button**
* **Name or ID**: These selectors can apply styling to all the elements of the same name. Name selectors have a preceding hash “**#**” symbol and appear in blue. For example, **#title** would apply the style to all the elements in the Hierarchy with the name **title***.*

  + **Note**: UXML name attributes (unlike HTML IDs) don’t need to be unique because UI Toolkit supports UXML templates and reusable components, allowing multiple elements to share the same name and style.
* **Style class**: A Style Class selector is a reusable style that can be applied to any visual element by adding the corresponding class name to the element’s Class List property. Style Class selectors have a preceding dot `.` character and appear in yellow. For example, **.smallFont** could be used to apply a specific style to any element by adding smallFont to its Class List.
* **Direct child:** If you add a **>** after the matching criteria, only the direct child elements matching the second criteria after the symbol > will be affected. For example, the selector **#title > Label**, would apply the style to any **Label** type inside the elements of the name `#title`. Any Label outside that parent or deeper in the hierarchy won’t be affected.
* **Child at any depth:** This is the same as the previous selector, but in this case the second matching criteria will apply to any child regardless of its depth in the parent hierarchy.

  + **Note**: Avoid overly broad selectors when possible (especially those ending in **\*** or targeting generic Unity classes like `.unity-button`). Deep child selectors can potentially slow down performance if they evaluate a large portion of the visual tree.
* **Pseudo-class:** Pseudo-classes allow you to define distinct styles for visual elements when they change state, such as when the mouse hovers over them or when they are focused. Pseudo-classes are denoted by a colon `:` and modify existing selectors.

  + For example, the selector Button `:focus` would apply specific styles to all Button elements when they are focused. This makes pseudo-classes useful for adding visual feedback, such as hover effects or focus indicators. Additionally, combining pseudo-classes with USS animations enables you to introduce smooth motion and dynamic transitions, enhancing the user experience.
  + You can read about the pseudo-classes [available here](../../UIE-USS-Selectors-Pseudo-Classes.md).

If a visual element matches multiple selectors, the selector with the highest [specificity](../../UIE-USS-Selectors.md#selector-specificity) takes precedence.

The specificity hierarchy in USS is as follows:

1. **Inline Styles**: Styles applied directly to an element (e.g., in UXML or through code) take the highest precedence and override all USS selectors.
2. **ID selectors** (#id): These are the most specific USS selectors and apply to elements with a unique name property.
3. **Class selectors** (.className): These apply to elements with the corresponding class added to their **Class List**.
4. **C# Type selectors** (e.g., Button, Label): These apply to all elements of the specified type.

For example, if an element has both an inline style and matches a #title ID selector, the inline style will override the ID selector. Similarly, if the element matches both a Class selector and a Type selector, the Class selector will take precedence.

In the case of a tie, where several selectors are trying to override the same property and all have the same level of specificity, the tie breaker will be the order in the USS style sheet, selectors lower in the list will take precedence.

You can learn more about selector precedence in the [documentation](../../UIE-USS-Selectors.md#determining-selector-precedence).

💡 **Tip: Additional information on Hierarchy**

Click the vertical ellipsis (**⋮**) in the Hierarchy header to further visualize the UI elements.

![Filter for different selectors in the Hierarchy](../../../uploads/Main/bpg/uitk/image190.png)

Filter for different selectors in the Hierarchy

In the Hierarchy pane, additional information appears next to the element Type. The **#options-bar** Name selector and **.options-bar** Style Class selector appear when checked.

You might notice that some selectors begin with the **.unity-** prefix. These are default styles that apply to all elements. Any defined selectors will override these values.

### Selectors assigned to elements

In the **Inspector**, you can visualize the matching selectors of a selected element in the Hierarchy. The selector at the bottom of the list has precedence. Unfold the details to see which style parameters are changing.

![A selected visual element shows its matching selectors in the Inspector](../../../uploads/Main/bpg/uitk/image256.png)

### Edit selectors

When modifying a Style selector, be sure to select the **Style Class** in the **Style Sheet** panel – not the visual element from the Hierarchy. Otherwise, you will change the inline style for a specific element and not the Style Class itself.

![Double-click the Style Class in the Inspector to ensure its active](../../../uploads/Main/bpg/uitk/image19.png)

Double-click the Style Class in the Inspector to ensure it’s active

You can double-click a Style Class in the Inspector to deselect an element and select the Style selector instead.

Just like when you were modifying parameters as inline styles directly in the UXML, you can edit parameters in the selectors, by selecting them in the StyleSheets pane, and modifying with overrides. The changes will also show as bold with a white line next to them. To unset a value you can do it from the vertical ellipsis (⋮) menu next to the property.

![Editing a USS selector](../../../uploads/Main/bpg/uitk/image241.png)

Editing a USS selector

With numerous formatting options available, you can modify the basic appearance of elements and fonts. UI Toolkit offers advanced styling that can reduce the need for custom-made **sprites**.

UI Builder can facilitate adding outlines, rounded corners, image adjustments, and border colors to your elements. Styling can also include bevel effects and the ability to change the cursor image.

### Override styles

Rules were meant to be broken. Whenever you define a style class for UI
elements, there will always be exceptions.

For example, if you have hundreds of Button elements, but each one has a different icon you don’t need to create a new selector for each one. This would defeat the purpose (convenience) of making styles reusable.

In lieu of this, you’d apply the same style to all of the buttons and then override the specific parts of each one that are unique (e.g., each Button element could override the **Background > Image** to use its own icon). These Overrides are the **Inline** **style** properties.

💡 **Tip: Inline styles take precedence over selectors**

Inline styles always take precedence over selectors. So if you’re unsure as to why a style is not updating when a selector is applied, it could be helpful to check the element to see if there are any Overrides.

### USS variables

You can create [USS variables](../../UIE-USS-CustomProperties.md) to save time manually setting up the same values in different properties. When you update a USS variable, all of the USS properties that use that variable update. In Unity 6.1 these variables can also be set up from the UI Builder Editor.

![Variables in the USS selectors are available for creating and editing in UI Builder in Unity 6.1.](../../../uploads/Main/bpg/uitk/image235.png)

Variables in the USS selectors are available for creating and editing in UI Builder in Unity 6.1.

You can create variables of the type: float, color, string, asset reference (for background images), dimensions (like pixels, degrees, percentage, etc) and enums. Variables have a selector level scope; you can’t use variables present in other selectors, but selectors themselves can be applied to as many elements as needed.

## USS transitions animations

![Setting a variable in a property instead of introducing the value directly.](../../../uploads/Main/bpg/uitk/image88.png)

Setting a variable in a property instead of introducing the value directly.

## USS transitions animations

Adding transitions to your menu screens can significantly enhance visual polish and user experience. UI Toolkit makes this relatively easy with the [Transition Animations](../../UIE-Transitions.md) property in the Inspector.

You can configure the Property, Duration, Easing, and Delay to set up the animation. Once configured, the transition is automatically applied when the relevant styles change during runtime.

Think of the transition between pseudo-classes of a Button – the **:hover** pseudo-class over the **.green-button** Class selector. Each style has its own size and color.

To define a transition in the mouse hover state, the **.green-button:hover** selector has Transition Animations, located at the bottom of the Inspector. The result is a Button that animates with your pointer movements.

![You can interpolate between styles with Transition Animations.](../../../uploads/Main/bpg/uitk/image207.png)

You can interpolate between styles with Transition Animations.

The Transition Animation interpolates between styles with the following
options:

* **Property**: This determines what to interpolate. The default setting is **all**, but you can select a specific property in the drop-down list. In the above example, **:hover** state is only modifying the **Color** and **Transform properties**. See [this complete list](../../UIE-USS-Properties-Reference.md) of animatable properties.
* **Duration**: This is the length of the transition, expressed in either seconds or milliseconds. For it to be visible, Duration must be set higher than 0.
* **Easing Function**: An easing function determines how an animation progresses over time, allowing you to simulate natural motion, such as acceleration, deceleration, or elasticity. By using an easing function, the **animation transitions** appear smoother and more organic compared to a basic linear interpolation, which moves at a constant speed.

Use [the following cheat sheet](https://easings.net/) to help you visualize the available functions (visualization courtesy of <https://easings.net/>):

![Cheat sheet to visualize the available functions.](../../../uploads/Main/bpg/uitk/image262.png)

Cheat sheet to visualize the available functions.

* **Delay:** Defined in seconds or milliseconds, this specifies how long to wait before starting the transition.
* **Add Transition:** Each property of the new state can be animated individually, with different durations, delays, and easing effects.

  + Click the **Add Transition** button to chain another transition animation. This makes it possible to trigger several overlapping transitions at once, making them more natural and less mechanical.

💡 **Tip: Transition events**

Callbacks for [transition events](../../UIE-Transition-Events.md) can be added to the visual elements being animated. They serve to support more advanced workflows, such as sequencing or looping.

Here are some common transition events with explanations for when they are sent:

— [TransitionRunEvent](../../../ScriptReference/UIElements.TransitionRunEvent.md): Sent when a transition is created
— [TransitionStartEvent](../../../ScriptReference/UIElements.TransitionStartEvent.md): Sent when a transition’s delay phase ends and the transition begins
— [TransitionEndEvent](../../../ScriptReference/UIElements.TransitionEndEvent.md): Sent when a transition ends
— [TransitionCancelEvent](../../../ScriptReference/UIElements.TransitionCancelEvent.md): Sent when a transition is canceled

Learn more about USS transitions in [this documentation](../../UIE-Transitions.md).

For visual elements, animations don’t require additional code because pseudo-classes (`:active`, `:inactive`, `:hover`, etc.) can have their own selectors. Whenever a pseudo-class triggers a style change, any defined transitions will automatically animate the change. For example: A button can grow or shrink when hovered (`:hover`), clicked (`:active`), or elements can fade out or become invisible based on user interaction or other events.

Pseudo-classes are predefined and you can’t make your own.

## Swap styles on demand

For any other events in your game you can also change styling in code using methods from the [UI Element APIs](../../../ScriptReference/UIElements.VisualElement.md).

For example, for changing to a different styling based on a character rarity, you can use the `RemoveFromClassList` and `AddToClassList` methods.

```
if (character.rarity == RarityType.Legendary)
{
  visualElement.RemoveFromClassList("common");
  visualElement.AddToClassList("legendary");
}
```

You can additionally trigger the pseudo-class `:active` or `:inactive` which is based on the enabled state of the visual element, to have USS transitions when changing state. This way, they can represent the before and after states.

💡 **Tip: Overriding Unity default selectors**

More complex visual elements, for example, a Tab view, are made of a parent element with children that are predefined by the system. They behave in a particular way when you add content to these elements and the styles used appear to be disabled and Unity-made. You can override any of these default selectors by double-clicking on the selector in use and make a copy to edit in your style sheet or USS.

## Themes

If you want to make a seasonal version of the UI or offer different color styles, [Theme Style Sheets (TSS)](../../UIE-tss.md) can simplify this process. Create a TSS via **Create > UI Toolkit > TSS theme file.**

TSS files are Asset files that operate like regular USS files. They provide a starting point for defining your own custom theme, made of USS selectors as well as Property and Variable settings.

![In this example of Halloween-themed UI elements, the Halloween TSS first inherits from the Unity Default Runtime TSS, then it adds theme-specific style sheets for Fonts and Buttons.](../../../uploads/Main/bpg/uitk/image194.png)

In this example of Halloween-themed UI elements, the Halloween TSS first inherits from the Unity Default Runtime TSS, then it adds theme-specific style sheets for Fonts and Buttons.

Inherited themes mean that if there are style sheets with selectors missing in the new theme, compared to the original one, then the latter’s styling will be applied. This makes customization easier. For example, you could create a new theme that only modifies fonts, while leaving the rest of the UI (such as colors, padding, or borders) styled according to the original theme. This approach is useful for scenarios like implementing light/dark mode, per-character UI customization, or creating game-specific event themes.

![The TSS for the Halloween theme represented in this screenshot uses the Halloween-buttons.uss but there’s no matching selector for the button’s in-use selector .button-accept, so it uses the one applied in the original theme.](../../../uploads/Main/bpg/uitk/image203.png)

The TSS for the Halloween theme represented in this screenshot uses the **Halloween-buttons.uss** but there’s no matching selector for the button’s in-use selector **.button-accept**, so it uses the one applied in the original theme.

A workflow to create new themes based on existing ones could be:

1. Create a new TSS, and add the theme to inherit from and the new USS file to be used by this new TSS.
2. In **UI Builder > StyleSheets**, click **Add Existing USS** and select the one that the new theme will use.
3. Copy the selector that the new theme will override.
4. Paste it in the USS that the new theme uses, then right-click and choose **Set as Active USS**.
5. Edit the selector in the new USS.
6. You can see the style used by one theme or another from the drop list in UI Builder.

![Choose which theme you want to apply in the UI Builder viewport.](../../../uploads/Main/bpg/uitk/image12.png)

Choose which theme you want to apply in the UI Builder viewport.

For runtime, reference your new theme in the **Theme Style Sheet** field of the **Panel Settings Inspector**.
