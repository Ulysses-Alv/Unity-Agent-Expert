# Execution order of test actions

When writing tests, it is possible to avoid duplication of code by using the [SetUp and TearDown](https://docs.nunit.org/articles/nunit/technical-notes/usage/SetUp-and-TearDown.html) methods built into [NUnit](http://www.nunit.org/). The Unity Test Framework has extended these methods with extra functionality, which can yield commands and skip frames, in the same way as [`UnityTest`](https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.test-framework@latest/index.html?subfolder=/api/UnityEngine.TestTools.UnityTestAttribute.html).

## Action execution order

The actions related to a test run in the following order:

* Attributes implementing [IApplyToContext](https://docs.nunit.org/articles/nunit/extending-nunit/IApplyToContext-Interface.html)
* Methods marked with [`[UnityOneTimeSetUp]`](https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.test-framework@latest/index.html?subfolder=/api/UnityEngine.TestTools.UnityOneTimeSetUpAttribute.html).
* Methods marked with [`[OneTimeSetup]`](https://docs.nunit.org/articles/nunit/writing-tests/attributes/onetimesetup.html).
* The `BeforeTest` method of any attribute implementing [IOuterUnityTestAction](https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.test-framework@latest/index.html?subfolder=/api/UnityEngine.TestTools.IOuterUnityTestAction.html).
* Methods marked with [`[UnitySetUp]`](https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.test-framework@latest/index.html?subfolder=/api/UnityEngine.TestTools.UnitySetUpAttribute.html).
* Attributes implementing [IWrapSetUpTearDown](https://docs.nunit.org/articles/nunit/extending-nunit/ICommandWrapper-Interface.html).
* Methods marked with [`[SetUp]`](https://docs.nunit.org/articles/nunit/writing-tests/attributes/setup.html).
* The `BeforeTest` method of [Action attributes](https://docs.nunit.org/articles/nunit/extending-nunit/Action-Attributes.html?q=action%20a).
* Attributes implementing [IWrapTestMethod](https://docs.nunit.org/articles/nunit/extending-nunit/ICommandWrapper-Interface.html).
* **The test itself runs**
* The `AfterTest` method of [Action attributes](https://docs.nunit.org/articles/nunit/extending-nunit/Action-Attributes.html?q=action%20a).
* Methods marked with [`[TearDown]`](https://docs.nunit.org/articles/nunit/writing-tests/attributes/teardown.html).
* Methods marked with [`[UnityTearDown]`](https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.test-framework@latest/index.html?subfolder=/api/UnityEngine.TestTools.UnityTearDownAttribute.html).
* The `AfterTest` method of any attribute implementing [IOuterUnityTestAction](https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.test-framework@latest/index.html?subfolder=/api/UnityEngine.TestTools.IOuterUnityTestAction.html).
* Methods marked with [`[OneTimeTearDown]`](https://docs.nunit.org/articles/nunit/writing-tests/attributes/onetimeteardown.html).
* Methods marked with [`[UnityOneTimeTearDown]`](https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.test-framework@latest/index.html?subfolder=/api/UnityEngine.TestTools.UnityOneTimeTearDownAttribute.html).

The list of actions is the same for both `Test` and `UnityTest`.
