# 2D and 3D projects

Unity is equally suited to creating both 2D and 3D games. When you create a new project, you choose either 2D or 3D mode. You may already know what you want to build, but there are a few subtle points that may affect which mode you choose.

The choice between starting in 2D or 3D mode determines some settings for the Unity Editor, such as whether images are imported as textures or **sprites**. You can swap between 2D or 3D mode at any time regardless of the mode you set when you created your project (see [2D and 3D Mode Settings](2DAnd3DModeSettings.md)). Here are some guidelines which should help you choose.

### Full 3D

3D games usually make use of three-dimensional geometry, with Materials and Textures rendered on the surface of **GameObjects** to make them appear as solid environments, characters and objects that make up your game world. The Camera can move in and around the **Scene** freely, with light and shadows cast around the world in a realistic way. 3D games usually render the Scene using perspective, so objects appear larger on screen as they get closer to the camera. For all games that fit this description, start in **3D** mode.

### Orthographic 3D

Sometimes games use 3D geometry, but use an orthographic camera instead of perspective. This is a common technique used in games which give you a bird’s-eye view of the action, and is sometimes called “2.5D”. If you’re making a game like this, you should also use the Editor in **3D** mode, because even though there is no *perspective*, you will still be working with 3D models and Assets. You’ll need to switch your [Camera](CamerasOverview.md) and [Scene view](SceneViewNavigation.md) to **Orthographic** though.

### Full 2D

Some examples of typical 2D game types

Many 2D games use flat graphics, sometimes called sprites, which have no three-dimensional geometry at all. They are drawn to the screen as flat images, and the game’s camera has no perspective. For this type of game, you should start the editor in **2D** mode.

### 2D gameplay with 3D graphics

Some 2D games use 3D geometry for the environment and characters, but restrict the *gameplay* to two dimensions. For example, the camera may show a side-scrolling view, and the player can only move in two dimensions, but the game itself still uses 3D models for the obstacles and a 3D perspective for the camera. For these games, the 3D effect may serve a stylistic rather than functional purpose. This type of game is *also* sometimes referred to as “2.5D”. Although the gameplay is 2D, you are mostly manipulating 3D models to build the game, so you should start the editor in **3D** mode.

### 2D gameplay and graphics with a perspective camera

This is another popular style of 2D game, using 2D graphics but with a perspective camera to get a parallax scrolling effect. This is a “cardboard theater”-style scene, where all graphics are flat, but arranged at different distances from the camera. It’s most likely that **2D** mode will suit your development in this case. However, you should change your [Camera’s](CamerasOverview.md) projection mode to **Perspective** and the [Scene view](SceneViewNavigation.md) mode to **3D**.
